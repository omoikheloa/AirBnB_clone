**AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter**

Description:
This project aims to develop a command-line interpreter for managing AirBnB objects. The command interpreter provides functionality to create, retrieve, update, and delete objects such as users, states, cities, and places within the AirBnB clone.

Command Interpreter:
The command interpreter is a Python-based application that allows users to interact with the AirBnB clone through a command-line interface. It follows a shell-like structure and supports various commands for managing AirBnB objects.

How to Start:
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system (version X.X or higher).
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Run the command python console.py to start the command interpreter.
How to Use:
Once the command interpreter is started, you can use various commands to manage AirBnB objects. Here are some examples of supported commands:

create <class_name>: Creates a new instance of the specified class.
show <class_name> <id>: Displays information about the specified instance.
update <class_name> <id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>": Updates the specified attribute of the instance.
destroy <class_name> <id>: Deletes the specified instance.
all <class_name>: Lists all instances of the specified class.
quit or EOF: Exits the command interpreter.
Examples:

To create a new user: create User
To show information about a user with ID 123: show User 123
To update the name of a city with ID 456: update City 456 name "New York"
To delete a place with ID 789: destroy Place 789
To list all users: all User
